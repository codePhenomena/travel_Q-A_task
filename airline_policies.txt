WELCOME TO THE POLICY MAZE — effective until further notice or until we change our mind, whichever comes first. This document supersedes all previous versions, except the one you printed last week, which is still valid for flights booked before 15th March 2024 but only if you’re flying from Terminal 2 and not on a Tuesday. For clarity, there is no clarity. Please continue reading at your own risk. Indigo, SpiceJet, Air India, and Vistara reserve the right to interpret, misinterpret, or ignore any clause at any time without prior intimation. Refunds are processed within 7–10 working days, where “working” excludes weekends, holidays, fog, heat, rain, and server maintenance.

BAGGAGE — the eternal battleground. Indigo allows 15 kg checked baggage for domestic economy passengers as per the standard fare rules published on 1st January 2024, but if you booked via a third-party OTA before 28th February 2024, the limit is 15 kg only if your PNR starts with 6E, otherwise it’s 15 kg minus 1 kg for flights departing between 0600 and 0900 hours because morning flights are heavier due to dew or something. Excess baggage is charged at ₹400 per kg if paid online at least 2 hours before departure, ₹450 per kg if paid between 2 hours and 45 minutes before departure, and ₹500 per kg at the airport counter unless the counter agent is in a good mood in which case it might be ₹450 but don’t quote us. Cabin baggage is 7 kg including laptop and ego but excluding duty-free liquor which must be carried in a transparent bag and shown to security who will confiscate it anyway if it’s over 100 ml or if they’re having a bad day. Vistara allows 15 kg checked in economy but 30 kg on international and 10 kg extra in Premium Economy but only if you’re a Club Vistara Platinum member or if you smile at check-in and say “namaste” with folded hands in which case the agent might upgrade your baggage allowance to 40 kg but only on flights operated by UK-registered aircraft not codeshare. Air India allows 25 kg domestic, 23 kg international economy, 30 kg business, 40 kg first, but if you’re flying from Mumbai to Dubai on a Tuesday in May, it’s 20 kg because of heat-related weight restrictions as per NOTAM AIC 018/24 which was cancelled but then reissued as AIC 022/24 so now it’s 23 kg again but only if your ticket was issued after 17th June 2024. SpiceJet allows 15 kg checked and 7 kg cabin but charges ₹500 per kg excess at counter even if you paid ₹400 online because “system not synced” as per their internal memo dated 12th March 2024 which was leaked on Twitter and then deleted but screenshots exist.

MEALS — or the lack thereof. Indigo does not provide complimentary meals on domestic flights under 90 minutes unless the flight is delayed by more than 2 hours in which case a ₹150 meal voucher is issued redeemable only at select outlets which are always closed. For flights over 90 minutes, pre-book meals are mandatory and cost ₹250–₹400 depending on whether you want veg, non-veg, Jain, or “surprise me” which is usually a stale sandwich. No free water. Buy from trolley. ₹100 for 500 ml. Air India provides free meals on all flights over 2 hours including hot meals on international sectors with a choice of Indian, Continental, or Jain but if you forget to pre-select 24 hours in advance you get whatever is left which is usually the chicken even if you’re vegetarian. Alcohol is complimentary on international flights in business and first but only after takeoff and only if the crew feels like opening the bar. Vistara provides complimentary meals on all flights including short domestic hops with real cutlery and Taj-curated menus but bamboo cutlery on select routes to save the planet but only if the flight departs after 1st July 2024 and only on A320neo aircraft not on wet-lease from Air India. SpiceJet has buy-on-board only with prices ranging from ₹150 for a sandwich to ₹300 for a “meal box” which contains one sandwich, one cookie, and one juice but stock runs out after row 10.

SEAT SELECTION — the illusion of choice. Indigo offers free seat selection during web check-in 48 hours to 1 hour before departure but only middle seats in the back unless you pay ₹300–₹800 for advance selection or ₹99 for auto-assigned window if you’re lucky. SpiceJet charges ₹150 for window or aisle, ₹99 for middle, and ₹400 for extra legroom but if you don’t pre-select you get auto-assigned a middle seat between two crying babies. Air India offers free seat selection at booking for all classes but preferred seats with extra legroom cost ₹500–₹2,000 and are non-refundable even if the flight is cancelled due to fog. Vistara offers free seat selection for Premium Economy and Business, ₹200–₹600 for economy, but if you’re a Club Vistara Gold member you get free advance selection including extra legroom but only if you log in via the app not the website because the website still shows old rules from 2023.

CANCELLATION & REFUNDS — the black hole. Indigo allows free cancellation within 24 hours of booking if departure is more than 7 days away but after that it’s ₹3,500 fee for domestic, ₹4,500 for international, and no refund if less than 3 hours to departure unless the cancellation is due to weather or technical in which case full refund within 48 hours but only if you fill Form 7B online and upload a selfie with your boarding pass and a newspaper showing the date. Weather includes fog, rain, heat, cold, wind, calm, and “operational reasons” which is code for “we don’t know.” SpiceJet charges ₹3,199 for cancellation more than 24 hours before departure, no refund if less than 24 hours, and full forfeiture for no-show but if the flight is cancelled by the airline you get full refund or rebooking but no hotel unless delay is more than 6 hours and only if you’re at the airport and only if the hotel has rooms and only if the airline feels like it. Air India charges ₹2,500 for domestic cancellation up to 3 hours before departure, 10% of fare or USD 100 whichever is lower for international, and full refund for medical emergencies with doctor certificate but only if the certificate is on hospital letterhead with stamp and signature and blood group and only if submitted within 7 days of cancellation. Vistara charges ₹2,999 domestic, USD 75 international up to 3 hours before departure, and offers Cancellation Protection Add-on for ₹399 which guarantees full refund no questions asked but only if purchased at booking and only if the cancellation is initiated via the app not call center because call center agents don’t have access to the add-on refund module.

WEB CHECK-IN — the digital gauntlet. Indigo web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 1 hour before departure but only if you’re not carrying check-in baggage in which case it closes 45 minutes before and only if you’re not flying from Srinagar in which case it closes 2 hours before because of security. Boarding gate closes 25 minutes before departure but if you’re at the gate 26 minutes before you’re offloaded and your baggage is removed and you have to pay ₹5,000 rebooking fee. SpiceJet web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 1 hour but crashes every Friday between 8 PM and 10 PM IST due to server overload so better do it on Thursday or pay ₹500 at counter. Air India web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 2 hours before international, 1 hour before domestic, but if you’re flying from Kochi it closes 3 hours before because of fog even in summer. Vistara web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 45 minutes before but if you’re a Club Vistara member it stays open until 30 minutes before but only if you’re checking in via the app and have biometric verification enabled.

LOYALTY PROGRAMS — the carrot and the stick. Indigo has no loyalty program because “we believe in low fares not points” but actually they have IndiGo Plus which gives priority check-in and free seat selection but costs ₹999 per year and is non-refundable even if you never fly. Air India has Flying Returns with 8 miles per ₹100 spent in economy, 10 in business, 12 in first, but miles expire after 3 years unless you fly once every 18 months or have a co-branded credit card which charges ₹1,500 annual fee. Vistara has Club Vistara with 1 CV Point per ₹100 spent, tier levels Silver, Gold, Platinum, with benefits like free seat selection, extra baggage, lounge access, but if you don’t fly 3 times in 12 months you drop to base level and lose everything. SpiceJet has SpiceClub with 1 point per ₹100 but points can only be redeemed for base fare not taxes and only on select routes and only if the flight is not full and only if the moon is in waxing phase.

SPECIAL ASSISTANCE — the fine print. Wheelchair assistance must be requested 48 hours in advance for Indigo, 24 hours for Air India, 72 hours for Vistara if you’re flying international, and never for SpiceJet because they don’t have wheelchairs at most airports. Unaccompanied minors aged 5–12 are accepted by all airlines but Indigo charges ₹1,500, Air India ₹2,000, Vistara ₹3,000, SpiceJet ₹1,500 but only if the child is potty trained and can recite the safety demo. Pets are allowed only in cargo by Indigo and Air India with kennel dimensions 28x20x20 inches max and weight 32 kg including pet but only on domestic flights and only if the temperature is between 10°C and 30°C at both origin and destination and only if the pet has a valid health certificate and only if the crew captain approves which he never does.

FORCE MAJEURE — the ultimate escape clause. All airlines reserve the right to cancel, delay, or divert any flight due to force majeure which includes but is not limited to weather, technical issues, crew shortage, ATC restrictions, bird strike, VIP movement, airport closure, runway resurfacing, fog, rain, heat, cold, wind, calm, pilot mood, cabin crew argument, catering truck delay, fuel shortage, fuel surplus, server downtime, app crash, payment gateway failure, passenger meltdown, security alert, fake bomb threat, real bomb threat, and “operational reasons” which is French for “we don’t feel like flying today.”

DISCLAIMER — the final nail. This policy document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a legal contract. All terms are subject to change without notice. In case of discrepancy between this document and the actual service, the actual service prevails. In case of dispute, the decision of the airline is final and binding. In case of complaint, please write to customer.care@airline.com which goes to a black hole. In case of escalation, please contact DGCA which will take 6 months to respond. In case of emergency, please pray.
