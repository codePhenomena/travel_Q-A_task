    "text": "WELCOME TO THE POLICY MAZE \u2014 effective until further notice or until we change our mind, whichever comes first. This document supersedes all previous versions, except the one you printed last week, which is still valid for flights booked before 15th March 2024 but only if you\u2019re flying from Terminal 2 and not on a Tuesday. For clarity, there is no clarity. Please continue reading at your own risk. Indigo, SpiceJet, Air India, and Vistara reserve the right to interpret, misinterpret, or ignore any clause at any time without prior intimation. Refunds are processed within 7\u201310 working days, where \u201cworking\u201d excludes weekends, holidays, fog, heat, rain, and server maintenance. BAGGAGE \u2014 the eternal battleground. Indigo allows 15 kg checked baggage for domestic economy passengers as per the standard fare rules published on 1st January 2024, but if you booked via a third-party OTA before 28th February 2024, the limit is 15 kg only if your PNR starts with 6E, otherwise it\u2019s 15 kg minus 1 kg for flights departing between 0600 and 0900 hours because morning flights are heavier due to dew or something. Excess baggage is charged at \u20b9400 per kg if paid online at least 2 hours before departure, \u20b9450 per kg if paid between 2 hours and 45 minutes before departure, and \u20b9500 per kg at the airport counter unless the counter agent is in a good mood in which case it might be \u20b9450 but don\u2019t quote us. Cabin baggage is 7 kg including laptop and ego but excluding duty-free liquor which must be carried in a transparent bag and shown to security who will confiscate it anyway if it\u2019s over 100 ml or if they\u2019re having a bad day. Vistara allows 15 kg checked in economy but 30 kg on international and 10 kg extra in Premium Economy but only if you\u2019re a Club Vistara Platinum member or if you smile at check-in and say \u201cnamaste\u201d with folded hands in which case the agent might upgrade your baggage allowance to 40 kg but only on flights operated by UK-registered aircraft not codeshare. Air India allows 25 kg domestic, 23 kg international economy, 30 kg business, 40 kg first, but if you\u2019re flying from Mumbai to Dubai on a Tuesday in May, it\u2019s 20 kg because of heat-related weight restrictions as per NOTAM AIC 018/24 which was cancelled but then reissued as AIC 022/24 so now it\u2019s 23 kg again but only if your ticket was issued after 17th June 2024. SpiceJet allows 15 kg checked and 7 kg cabin but charges \u20b9500 per kg excess at counter even if you paid \u20b9400 online because \u201csystem not synced\u201d as per their internal memo dated 12th March 2024 which was leaked on Twitter and then deleted but screenshots exist. MEALS \u2014 or the lack thereof."

    "text": "Indigo does not provide complimentary meals on domestic flights under 90 minutes unless the flight is delayed by more than 2 hours in which case a \u20b9150 meal voucher is issued redeemable only at select outlets which are always closed. For flights over 90 minutes, pre-book meals are mandatory and cost \u20b9250\u2013\u20b9400 depending on whether you want veg, non-veg, Jain, or \u201csurprise me\u201d which is usually a stale sandwich. No free water. Buy from trolley. \u20b9100 for 500 ml. Air India provides free meals on all flights over 2 hours including hot meals on international sectors with a choice of Indian, Continental, or Jain but if you forget to pre-select 24 hours in advance you get whatever is left which is usually the chicken even if you\u2019re vegetarian. Alcohol is complimentary on international flights in business and first but only after takeoff and only if the crew feels like opening the bar. Vistara provides complimentary meals on all flights including short domestic hops with real cutlery and Taj-curated menus but bamboo cutlery on select routes to save the planet but only if the flight departs after 1st July 2024 and only on A320neo aircraft not on wet-lease from Air India. SpiceJet has buy-on-board only with prices ranging from \u20b9150 for a sandwich to \u20b9300 for a \u201cmeal box\u201d which contains one sandwich, one cookie, and one juice but stock runs out after row 10. SEAT SELECTION \u2014 the illusion of choice. Indigo offers free seat selection during web check-in 48 hours to 1 hour before departure but only middle seats in the back unless you pay \u20b9300\u2013\u20b9800 for advance selection or \u20b999 for auto-assigned window if you\u2019re lucky. SpiceJet charges \u20b9150 for window or aisle, \u20b999 for middle, and \u20b9400 for extra legroom but if you don\u2019t pre-select you get auto-assigned a middle seat between two crying babies. Air India offers free seat selection at booking for all classes but preferred seats with extra legroom cost \u20b9500\u2013\u20b92,000 and are non-refundable even if the flight is cancelled due to fog. Vistara offers free seat selection for Premium Economy and Business, \u20b9200\u2013\u20b9600 for economy, but if you\u2019re a Club Vistara Gold member you get free advance selection including extra legroom but only if you log in via the app not the website because the website still shows old rules from 2023. CANCELLATION & REFUNDS \u2014 the black hole. Indigo allows free cancellation within 24 hours of booking if departure is more than 7 days away but after that it\u2019s \u20b93,500 fee for domestic, \u20b94,500 for international, and no refund if less than 3 hours to departure unless the cancellation is due to weather or technical in which case full refund within 48 hours but only if you fill Form 7B online and upload a selfie with your boarding pass and a newspaper showing the date."

Air India charges \u20b92,500 for domestic cancellation up to 3 hours before departure, 10% of fare or USD 100 whichever is lower for international, and full refund for medical emergencies with doctor certificate but only if the certificate is on hospital letterhead with stamp and signature and blood group and only if submitted within 7 days of cancellation. Vistara charges \u20b92,999 domestic, USD 75 international up to 3 hours before departure, and offers Cancellation Protection Add-on for \u20b9399 which guarantees full refund no questions asked but only if purchased at booking and only if the cancellation is initiated via the app not call center because call center agents don\u2019t have access to the add-on refund module. WEB CHECK-IN \u2014 the digital gauntlet. Indigo web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 1 hour before departure but only if you\u2019re not carrying check-in baggage in which case it closes 45 minutes before and only if you\u2019re not flying from Srinagar in which case it closes 2 hours before because of security. Boarding gate closes 25 minutes before departure but if you\u2019re at the gate 26 minutes before you\u2019re offloaded and your baggage is removed and you have to pay \u20b95,000 rebooking fee. SpiceJet web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 1 hour but crashes every Friday between 8 PM and 10 PM IST due to server overload so better do it on Thursday or pay \u20b9500 at counter. Air India web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 2 hours before international, 1 hour before domestic, but if you\u2019re flying from Kochi it closes 3 hours before because of fog even in summer. Vistara web check-in opens 48 hours and closes 45 minutes before but if you\u2019re a Club Vistara member it stays open until 30 minutes before but only if you\u2019re checking in via the app and have biometric verification enabled. LOYALTY PROGRAMS \u2014 the carrot and the stick. Indigo has no loyalty program because \u201cwe believe in low fares not points\u201d but actually they have IndiGo Plus which gives priority check-in and free seat selection but costs \u20b9999 per year and is non-refundable even if you never fly. Air India has Flying Returns with 8 miles per \u20b9100 spent in economy, 10 in business, 12 in first, but miles expire after 3 years unless you fly once every 18 months or have a co-branded credit card which charges \u20b91,500 annual fee."

SpiceJet has SpiceClub with 1 point per \u20b9100 but points can only be redeemed for base fare not taxes and only on select routes and only if the flight is not full and only if the moon is in waxing phase. SPECIAL ASSISTANCE \u2014 the fine print. Wheelchair assistance must be requested 48 hours in advance for Indigo, 24 hours for Air India, 72 hours for Vistara if you\u2019re flying international, and never for SpiceJet because they don\u2019t have wheelchairs at most airports. Unaccompanied minors aged 5\u201312 are accepted by all airlines but Indigo charges \u20b91,500, Air India \u20b92,000, Vistara \u20b93,000, SpiceJet \u20b91,500 but only if the child is potty trained and can recite the safety demo.

FORCE MAJEURE \u2014 the ultimate escape clause. All airlines reserve the right to cancel, delay, or divert any flight due to force majeure which includes but is not limited to weather, technical issues, crew shortage, ATC restrictions, bird strike, VIP movement, airport closure, runway resurfacing, fog, rain, heat, cold, wind, calm, pilot mood, cabin crew argument, catering truck delay, fuel shortage, fuel surplus, server downtime, app crash, payment gateway failure, passenger meltdown, security alert, fake bomb threat, real bomb threat, and \u201coperational reasons\u201d which is French for \u201cwe don\u2019t feel like flying today.\u201d DISCLAIMER \u2014 the final nail.

    "text": "It started with a whisper in January \u2014 the kind of rumor that spreads faster than fog over the Yamuna. A senior executive at a low-cost carrier, sipping overpriced coffee at the Taj Mansingh, told a journalist friend that domestic travel was \u201cabout to explode.\u201d He had numbers: bookings up 22% week-on-week since Diwali. The journalist scribbled it down, posted it on LinkedIn, and by evening, every travel influencer from Goa to Guwahati was quoting \u201cindustry sources\u201d saying 2024 would be the biggest year since 2019. No one asked which airline, which route, or whether the data included cancellations. It didn\u2019t matter. The narrative was set. By February, the whisper became a roar. The Ministry of Civil Aviation released a press note \u2014 buried on page 7 of a 400-page annual report \u2014 claiming domestic passenger traffic had crossed 140 million in calendar year 2023. If you squinted, that meant 2024 could hit 165 million. The math was shaky. Someone forgot to adjust for leap year. Someone else forgot that 2023 included two pandemic-free festive seasons. But the headline wrote itself: \u201cIndia Set for 18% Travel Boom in 2024.\u201d It was shared 42,000 times. No one read past the first paragraph. Then came the heat. May arrived like a slap. Delhi touched 48\u00b0C. Jaipur recorded 49.2\u00b0C. Pilots started refusing takeoffs. One captain, speaking anonymously to a regional paper, said, \u201cWe\u2019re not flying ovens.\u201d Indigo issued a quiet internal memo \u2014 leaked, of course \u2014 instructing crews to reduce payload by 800 kg on high-temperature days. That meant fewer passengers, less baggage, more cancellations. The same airline that had boasted \u201crecord bookings\u201d in January was now grounding flights from Delhi to Jaipur, Leh, and Srinagar. A passenger stuck in Jaipur tweeted a photo of a digital thermometer reading 51\u00b0C inside the terminal. The caption: \u201cWelcome to India\u2019s aviation miracle.\u201d It got 1.8 million views. But the real story wasn\u2019t in the headlines. It was in the cracks. In Goa, a boutique hotel owner named Maya told me over filter coffee that her bookings were up 68% \u2014 not from Mumbai or Delhi, but from Bengaluru. \u201cTechies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey work remotely, fly in on Thursday, leave Monday. No weekends. No families. Just laptops and beach Wi-Fi.\u201d She had converted her garage into a co-working space. Charged \u20b9800 per day. Always full. Meanwhile, the big resorts in North Goa were running at 42% occupancy. They blamed \u201covertourism.\u201d Maya laughed. \u201cOvertourism is a marketing problem. These guys built 200-room monsters and expected 2019 to return. It didn\u2019t.\u201d Across the country, in Shillong, a different kind of boom was brewing. The state tourism board had launched a campaign called \u201cEscape to the Clouds.\u201d They paid influencers to post drone shots of mist-covered hills. One video \u2014 a girl in a red raincoat standing on a glass skywalk \u2014 went viral with 28 million views. Within weeks, SpiceJet and Indigo added extra flights to UML. Most were half-empty. The girl in the red raincoat?"

    "text": "She was from Delhi. Flew in, shot the video, flew out. Never stayed overnight. The skywalk? Closed for maintenance six months a year. But the narrative stuck: Meghalaya was the new Goa. International travel, meanwhile, was bleeding. A senior official at Mumbai\u2019s Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport told me \u2014 off the record, over chai at 3 a.m. \u2014 that outbound traffic was down 11% in the first quarter. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t flying to Dubai anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re flying to Bangkok. Same price, better visa.\u201d He showed me a spreadsheet. Delhi\u2013Dubai average fare: \u20b936,000. Delhi\u2013Bangkok: \u20b924,000. Visa on arrival. No hotel quarantine. No PCR test. The math was brutal. Air India had cut three weekly flights to London. Emirates responded by adding capacity. The passenger didn\u2019t care. They just wanted the cheapest ticket. But not everyone was cutting back. In Kochi, a travel agent named Joseph showed me his ledger. \u201cBusiness class to the Gulf is full,\u201d he said. \u201cNot leisure. Not tourists. Workers. Engineers. Nurses. They\u2019re going back. Salaries are up. Remittances are up. They don\u2019t care about economy.\u201d He flipped the page. \u201cBut look \u2014 Mumbai to New York? Down 32%. Who can afford $1,800 one-way?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cRich people fly private now.\u201d The private jet boom was the quietest trend of the year. A startup in Bengaluru called FlyNow raised $42 million to offer \u201cjet pooling\u201d \u2014 think Uber Black, but for Cessnas. You book a seat from Bengaluru to Coimbatore for \u20b942,000. Sounds insane. Until you realize the same passenger was paying \u20b918,000 for a 6 a.m. Indigo flight, waiting two hours in security, and arriving stressed. FlyNow\u2019s planes had Wi-Fi, coffee, and no middle seat. They were full every weekend. The founder, a former Swiggy executive, told Forbes India: \u201cWe\u2019re not selling travel. We\u2019re selling time.\u201d The article was titled \u201cThe Death of Commercial Aviation?\u201d It was clickbait. But the seed was planted. Back in the mainstream, the numbers kept shifting. In June, a consultancy released a report saying domestic travel grew \u201conly 12%\u201d in H1 2024. The Ministry called it \u201cmisleading.\u201d The consultancy stood by its data. The argument spilled onto Twitter. One side shared graphs. The other shared press releases. No one agreed on the baseline. Was it 2019? 2022? 2023? Each year had its own asterisks. Pandemic recovery. Election slowdown. Fuel surcharge hikes. No one adjusted for inflation. Or for the fact that half the \u201cgrowth\u201d came from new routes to tier-3 cities no one had heard of. Take Bagdogra, for example. In 2023, it had 11 weekly flights. In 2024, it had 42. Indigo, SpiceJet, and Akasa were fighting for slots. A local journalist wrote a piece titled \u201cBagdogra: India\u2019s New Travel Hub?\u201d It was picked up by national media. Suddenly, everyone was talking about Siliguri as the gateway to the Northeast. A five-star chain announced a 180-room property. Construction began. Then, in September, the airport authority said the runway couldn\u2019t handle wide-body aircraft. The project was paused. The article was forgotten."

    "text": "The narrative moved on. Sustainability became the new buzzword. Indigo announced it had planted 100,000 trees. Vistara switched to bamboo cutlery. Air India claimed its new fuel-efficient A350s would reduce emissions by 20%. No one asked how many trees it takes to offset one Delhi\u2013Mumbai flight. Or whether bamboo cutlery was recycled. Or whether the A350s were actually flying \u2014 they were still in Toulouse, waiting for cabin fittings. But the press releases worked. ESG funds poured in. Stock prices ticked up. Passengers felt better. The planet? Not so much. Workations were the other big story. A survey \u2014 conducted by a co-working startup, naturally \u2014 claimed 3.2 million Indians worked remotely from hill stations in 2024. Manali, Dharamshala, and Coorg were full. Cafes installed 100 Mbps fiber. Homestays added desks. One property in Munnar advertised \u201cunlimited coffee and mountain views.\u201d Booked solid for 14 months. A software engineer from Hyderabad told me he hadn\u2019t been to his office in 18 months. \u201cWhy fly to Bengaluru for a meeting when I can join from a balcony?\u201d He paid \u20b945,000 a month for a cottage. His company paid for the flight. Win-win. But not every trend was upward. Rail + air combos surged 180%. IRCTC and MakeMyTrip launched joint tickets. You fly into Delhi, take the Vande Bharat to Agra, return by flight. Seamless. Cheap. Popular. Until the train was delayed. Or the flight was cancelled. Then the passenger was stuck in Mathura with a non-refundable hotel. One couple from Chennai spent their anniversary in a railway waiting room. They posted a selfie with the caption: \u201cTravel goals.\u201d It got 12,000 likes. Solo female travel became a movement. A 29-year-old designer from Pune quit her job, sold her scooter, and spent six months traveling alone. She started in Spiti, ended in Kerala. Documented everything on Instagram. Brands sent free stays. She wrote a book. It sold 40,000 copies. Suddenly, every travel startup was marketing \u201csafe homestays for women.\u201d Some were legit. Some were just pink logos. One hostel in Rishikesh advertised \u201cfemale-only dorms\u201d \u2014 then put men in the next room. The backlash was swift. The hashtag #SafeTravelMyFoot trended for three days. Food became a battleground. Air India bragged about free meals. Passengers complained they were cold. Indigo sold sandwiches for \u20b9300. Passengers said they were stale. Vistara served Taj-curated menus in economy. Passengers posted photos. SpiceJet offered \u201cbuy-on-board\u201d \u2014 but half the flights had no stock. One passenger on a red-eye from Delhi to Bengaluru was offered a \u20b9200 cookie. He laughed so hard the crew gave it for free. Technology was supposed to fix everything. Apps promised real-time tracking. Delays. Cancellations. Baggage carousels. But the APIs broke. The push notifications failed. One passenger got an alert saying his flight landed \u2014 while he was still at the gate. Another got a baggage update saying his suitcase was in Goa \u2014 he was flying to Goa. The suitcase was in Goa. He was not. UPI became king."

    "text": "74% of bookings were paid via UPI. Travel agents hated it. \u201cNo float,\u201d one said. \u201cMoney comes in, money goes out. No 30-day credit.\u201d But passengers loved it. Instant. No card fees. One-click. A grandmother in Lucknow booked her first flight using Google Pay. Her son guided her over the phone. She flew to Mumbai to see her newborn grandson. Cried at the gate. The gate agent took a selfie. It went viral. Then came the crash. In August, a major payment gateway went down for 14 hours. Bookings froze. Refunds pending. Call centers flooded. One airline \u2014 no one will say which \u2014 lost \u20b918 crore in a single day. The CEO sent an internal email: \u201cThis cannot happen again.\u201d It was leaked. The stock fell 6%. The narrative shifted: \u201cIs India\u2019s travel boom built on sand?\u201d By October, the festive season arrived. Diwali. Christmas. New Year. Everyone wanted to fly home. Airlines added flights. Airports added counters. Chaos ensued. Delhi saw 42 cancellations in one morning. Mumbai had 38. A passenger live-tweeted from the tarmac: \u201cSitting in plane. Engine off. AC off. 42\u00b0C outside. Welcome to peak season.\u201d The tweet was retweeted by a Bollywood actor. The airline responded with a \u20b9500 voucher. The passenger replied: \u201cKeep it.\u201d But some things worked. Vistara launched a campaign: \u201cZero Cancellation Guarantee\u201d for business class. If your flight was cancelled, full refund, free rebooking, and a night at the Taj. Only 42 passengers claimed it all year. But the perception? Priceless. Indigo tried something similar \u2014 \u201cFog-Proof Winter\u201d \u2014 but cancelled 320 flights in January anyway. The campaign was quietly pulled. The year ended with a surprise. In December, a little-known airline \u2014 Akasa Air \u2014 overtook SpiceJet in market share. Not by much. 0.8%. But enough to make headlines. The CEO, a former IndiGo executive, gave one interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t compete on price,\u201d he said. \u201cWe compete on reliability.\u201d His on-time performance: 94.2%. SpiceJet\u2019s: 68.1%. The gap was glaring. As the clock struck midnight on December 31, 2024, a passenger in Goa raised a glass of feni and toasted: \u201cTo the year we almost got it right.\u201d No one knew what he meant. But everyone drank. The data will be debated for years. The 18% growth. The 7% decline. The workations. The private jets. The bamboo cutlery. The viral skywalks. The cold meals. The free upgrades. The missed weddings. The melted chocolates. The grandmother\u2019s first flight. The engineer on the balcony. The girl in the red raincoat. 2024 wasn\u2019t a boom. It wasn\u2019t a bust. It was a mirror. And India \u2014 chaotic, contradictory, unstoppable \u2014 looked into it and saw itself flying."
