App Review | Indigo | 6E-217 | DEL→BOM | Rating: 1★

Flight cancelled at 5 AM. No SMS. Reached airport at 4 AM; security said “cancelled”. Indigo counter empty. Customer care wait: 45 min. Reason given: weather, but GoAir flew same time. Refund in 7 days. Very poor experience.

Complaint: Flight 6E217 cancelled. Questions airline’s “fog excuse” since GoAir operated normally.
